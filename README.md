Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger
                                                                    
## Overview
This is my first attempt at Kaggle's beginner machine learning excercise.

Titanic competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Dependencies:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Supervised Learning
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms

## What's in this Repository?
* `titanic.ipynb` : The Jupyter notebook that includes all explanations, code and visualizations
* Data: Includes dataset provided by Kaggle for the competition
    * `train.csv` : Training data
    * `test.csv` : Testing data
* Visualizations: Includes all plots generated from the training data
   * `AgeGroup-Survived.jpg` : Plot of AgeGroup vs. Survived features
   * `CabinBool-Survived.jpg` : Plot of CabinBool vs. Survived features
   * `Parch-Survived.jpg` : Plot of Parch vs. Survived features
   * `Pclass-Survived.jpg` : Plot of Pclass vs. Survived features
   * `Sex-Survived.jpg` : Plot of Sex vs. Survived features
   * `SibSp-Survived.jpg` : Plot of SibSp vs. Survived features
* Output: Includes submission file generated from Random Forest model
   * `result.csv` : Predictions file

This Notebook will show basic examples of:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
